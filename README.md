This work represents the Space Debris Trails Simulation using SGP4 model. The actual trails are generated by considering the magnitude, albedo, distance of the satellite, CCD's specifications like field of view, noise, atmospheric extinction, diffraction, and quantum efficiency. The code and report are in the files.
